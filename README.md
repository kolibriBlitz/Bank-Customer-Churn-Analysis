# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Navigation
- [Jupyter Notebooks](Code): Just the code and nothing but the code...and the Markdown
- [Documentation](Maven-Guide): The tasks provided by Maven Analytics to guide me through the data analysis process
- [Data](Data): Repository of csv and xslx files of the data used
- [Deliverables](deliverables): Examples of project deliverables including their documentation

## Project Goals
- Practice Python skills through hands-on, iterative querying.
- Think like a customer analyst by looking for patterns, spotting anomalies, and turning data into actionable strategies.
- Advise a fictional bank on characteristics that indicate custimer attrition is likely.

## Tech Stack
- Python: data cleaning, EDA and data preparation for modeling, and data analysis
- Jupyter notebooks: structure for coding and documentation
- Power BI: insight visualization
- Tableau: insight visualization
- StreamLit: high level reporting for executives

## Methodology
1. Setup and Import
    1. *Getting to know you*: Studied dataframes for possible join relationships, column names and column data types. Looked at a few rows of data in each table to get a feel for what is there and what might need to be adjusted. 
2. Data Cleaning
    1. *Cleanliness is next to Godliness*: Checked data for anomalies and missing data to ensure accurate results.
4. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    1. *To the final frontier*: Studied the target variable and the feature options. Visualized relationships, distributions and correlations.
6. Data Preparation
    1. *Are you ready for this?*: Created dummy variables, used feature engineering and ... there was a third thing, I swear.
8. Regression Analysis
    1. *I do my little turn on the catwalk*: Began analysis with a linear regression base.
10. Cluster Analysis
    1. *Clique bait*: Cluster analysis
